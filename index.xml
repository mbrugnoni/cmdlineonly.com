      <title>Passing the AZ-104 Azure Administrator Exam</title>

      <description>I was able to pass the AZ-104 exam with minimal resources and minimal time dedicated to studying. Over the course of a couple months, I studied part-time - mostly when I had free time at night. I used this certification path as an outline to get more familiar with Azure. Although the exam is all multiple choice, and the benefit you get from those types of exams isn&amp;rsquo;t much, it does point you in the right direction on which areas to focus on if you want to learn about Azure administration.</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Mike.
This site was created as a test bed for learning and documenting some projects I&amp;rsquo;m working on. We&amp;rsquo;ll see what it evolves into over time. It was initially created as the result of learning how to use Hugo, Github Actions, and Azure Static Web pages.
Some areas my projects will currently be focused on:
 Azure AWS Ansible Terraform Kubernetes And probably much more!  </description>
