      <description>I just recently passed the Terraform Associate exam. I wanted to share my experience on what I thought about the exam, as well as the study material I used.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any background in using Terraform up until a couple months ago. It looked like an interesting tool for expanding my IaC which was previously limited to mostly Ansible. I started looking into it and really enjoyed the way infrastructure was defined using HCL.</description>
