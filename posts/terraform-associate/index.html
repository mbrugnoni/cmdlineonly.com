        <p>I just recently passed the Terraform Associate exam. I wanted to share my experience on what I thought about the exam, as well as the study material I used.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have any background in using Terraform up until a couple months ago. It looked like an interesting tool for expanding my IaC which was previously limited to mostly Ansible. I started looking into it and really enjoyed the way infrastructure was defined using HCL. I have decent base of general scripting/programming concepts, but HCL is fairly easy to understand and if you&rsquo;ve worked with JSON/YAML it will be very similar.</p>
<p>As far as study material went, I used the course on <a href="https://kodekloud.com/courses/hashicorp-certified-terraform-associate/">KodeKloud</a> that was geared toward the certification. Outside of that, I did a bunch of messing around both in my home lab, as well as in my personal Azure environment. If you&rsquo;re already using Terraform in the enterprise, or even frequently use it for personal use, the exam should be fairly easy. The only thing that may be an outlier - if you&rsquo;ve never used it - is the Terraform Cloud offering. There is a subset of questions geared toward that offering, but they are pretty basic. You should understand the general features Terraform Cloud provides and what the enterprise offerings are on top of that. You don&rsquo;t need to know the features in depth - just be aware of what they are.</p>
<p>It was one of the cheapest certification exams I have taken at $70. At that price, there&rsquo;s no reason not to take it if it&rsquo;s relevant to your career. Overall, I thought it was a fun exam to study for and really got me more interested in pursuing the use of Terraform further. The exam is an associate level certification, so there&rsquo;s definitely potential for HashiCorp to add on a more practical &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; level exam in the future.</p>
