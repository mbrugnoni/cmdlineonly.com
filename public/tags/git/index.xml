      <description>I started looking into the Zettelkasten method of note taking recently. There are many ways to go about accomplishing it digitally, but I wanted something simple and straight forward. Ideally, it would be in a format that is as universal as possible, without lock in to some type of proprietary client. I wanted to be able to easily sync across devices, and access the notes via Linux terminal.
After reading into some options, I settled upon using GitHub as my notes repo.</description>
